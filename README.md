## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

This guide will help you set up and run the entire project locally using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker & Docker Compose
-   Git
-   An API Key from an AI provider (e.g., Google AI Studio for Gemini).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and paste the following content into it.

    ```env
    # ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
    # *** YOU ONLY NEED TO PROVIDE ONE API KEY FOR THE AGENT TO WORK ***
    # *** THE FREE API KEY FROM aistudio.google.com IS RECOMMENDED ***
    # *** FOR A SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE, USE THE gemini-2.5-pro MODEL ***

    # --- Agent API Keys (Choose and fill one) --- 
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_or_mistral_key_here"
    MISTRAL_MODEL_ID="mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct"

    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_MODEL_ID='gemini/gemini-2.5-pro'

    OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
    OPENAI_MODEL_ID='gpt-4-turbo'

    # --- MongoDB Credentials ---
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password

    # --- Mongo Express UI Credentials ---
    ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_USERNAME=admin
    ME_CONFIG_BASICAUTH_PASSWORD=password

    # --- Spring Boot Admin Credentials ---
    SPRING_ADMIN_USER=admin
    SPRING_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret_password

    # --- Internal Service URLs (for Docker Compose) ---
    # These should not be changed for local development
    GO_EXECUTOR_URL="http://go-executor-service:8090"
    VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:8080"
    ```
    **Remember to replace `"your_..._key_here"` with your actual API key.**

3.  **Run the entire stack:**
    From the root directory, execute the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build the images for all services and start them. The `--build` flag is important for the first run and whenever you make code changes.

### Verification

Once all containers are running, you can access the services at:

-   **Frontend Application**: `http://localhost:4321`
-   **Backend API (Health)**: `http://localhost:8080/management/health`
-   **AI Agent API (Health)**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
-   **Mongo Express UI**: `http://localhost:8081`
-   **Grafana Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3000`
-   **Prometheus UI**: `http://localhost:9090`

## Frontend (`go_agent_frontend`)

The user interface is built with Astro for maximum performance, leveraging a modular architecture and Preact for interactive components.

```mermaid
graph LR
    User --> Browser
    Browser -- Renders --> Astro[Static HTML/CSS]
    Browser -- Hydrates --> PreactIsland[Preact Chat Component]
    PreactIsland -- AJAX/Fetch --> BackendAPI[Backend API]
```

-   **Astro Framework**: Provides an "Islands Architecture" where most of the site is static HTML, ensuring instant load times. Only interactive components are loaded as JavaScript.
-   **Preact Islands**: The chat interface is a highly interactive component built with Preact, which is "hydrated" on the client-side.
-   **AJAX Communication**: The Preact chat component communicates with the Spring Boot backend asynchronously via the Fetch API to send prompts and receive responses.
-   **Modular Architecture**: Components are organized by feature (chat, info, navigation) for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Backend (`go_tutor_backend`)

The backend is a robust, enterprise-grade application built on Spring Boot, serving as the central hub that connects the frontend to the AI agent and manages data persistence.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend Request] --> B{Controller Layer};
    B --> C[Service Layer];
    C --> D{TutorAgentClient};
    C --> E{ConversationRepository};
    D --> F[AI Agent Service];
    E --> G[(MongoDB)];
```

-   **SOLID Principles & Layered Architecture**: The code is strictly organized into layers (Controller, Service, Repository, Client) to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
-   **MongoDB Integration**: Used for storing conversation histories, allowing for future analysis and potential fine-tuning of the agent.
-   **JUnit5 & Mockito**: A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests ensures code quality and reliability.

## AI Agent (`go_tutor_agent`)

The core intelligence of the system. This Python service uses FastAPI for its API and the `smol-agents` library to orchestrate a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop.

```mermaid
graph TD
    AgentCore[Agent Core ] -->|Chooses Tool| Tools
    Tools --> RAG[RAG Tool]
    Tools --> Sandbox[Code Sandbox]
    Tools --> FileReader[File Reader]
    Tools --> Translator[Translator Tool]
    Tools --> Indexer[URL Indexer]
```

-   **FastAPI Framework**: Provides a high-performance, asynchronous API for the agent.
-   **Smol-Agents Library**: A lightweight framework for building autonomous agents with reasoning capabilities.
-   **Modular Toolset**: The agent is equipped with five distinct tools:
  
    1.  **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Searches a ChromaDB vector database to provide contextually relevant answers.
    2.  **File Reader**: Reads directly from the local `/data` directory to access curated Go lessons.
    3.  **URL Indexer**: Scrapes and indexes content from web pages to expand its knowledge base.
    4.  **Code Sandbox**: Delegates Go code execution to the secure `go_executor_service`.
    5.  **Translator**: Ensures all final responses are delivered in Spanish.
    
-   **Model Extensibility**: Designed to be model-agnostic, easily configurable to use models from Gemini, Mistral, or OpenAI.

## Monitoring Stack

A full observability stack is included to monitor the health and performance of all services.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Services
        B[Backend]
        D[AI Agent]
        E[Go Sandbox]
    end
    
    subgraph Visualization
        K[Grafana Dashboards]
    end

    B -- Metrics --> I[Prometheus]
    D -- Metrics --> I
    
    B -- Logs --> J[Promtail]
    D -- Logs --> J
    E -- Logs --> J
    
    J -- Pushes Logs --> L[Loki]
    
    I -- DataSource --> K
    L -- DataSource --> K
```

-   **Prometheus**: Scrapes and stores time-series metrics from the backend and AI agent for performance monitoring.
-   **Promtail**: An agent that collects logs from all running Docker containers.
-   **Loki**: A log aggregation system, inspired by Prometheus, that stores and makes logs queryable.
-   **Grafana**: The visualization platform. It connects to Prometheus and Loki as data sources to create dashboards that display metrics and logs in one place.
